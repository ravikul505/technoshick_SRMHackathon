Remote patient examination
Build a mobile app that enables doctors to gain real-time access to a patient’s vital signs from anywhere in the world. The mobile solution should allow doctors to gauge a patient’s condition to determine whether hospitalization is necessary.

The solution can also provide general medical assistance and will be especially useful in cases of emergencies.
